This guide assumes you have a working RDM installed. RDM only supports UIcons repositories. Check out this [link]( https://github.com/UIcons/UIcons) for more information about UIcons. You can provide multiple styles and each user can select their preferred choice in the front-end. Download your images from trusted sources, ask in our Discord server if you have any questions. 

## Some options to pick icons from
Itâ€™s recommended to just git clone the repository into the desired path
* [nileplumb's PkmnShuffleMap](https://github.com/nileplumb/PkmnShuffleMap/tree/master/UICONS)
* [nileplumb's PkmnHomeIcons](https://github.com/nileplumb/PkmnHomeIcons/tree/master/UICONS)
* [whitewillem's PogoAssets](https://github.com/whitewillem/PogoAssets/tree/main/uicons)
* [whitewillem's PogoAssets-outline](https://github.com/whitewillem/PogoAssets/tree/main/uicons-outline)

## Docker
You can either leave the default embedded image volume from the docker-compose.yml or you can embed a specific directory as volume
* `/absolute/path/to/images:/app/resources/webroot/static/img`
* or `.relative/path/to/images:/app/resources/webroot/static/img`
If you want embed the needed directoy of uicon style directly, you could embed also as follows
* `./images/PkmnShuffleMap/UICONS: /app/resources/webroot/static/img/PkmnShuffleMap `
* `./images/PogoAssets/uicons: /app/resources/webroot/static/img/PogoAssets`
RDM needs write-access to the folder, it will generate a few combined images.

## Non-Docker
Place all image styles in `resources/webroot/static/img`.
Each style needs a separate folder.

## Dashboard Settings
To include the image styles add them like this in the frontend settings  
![dashbaord uicons](img/dashboard-uicons.png)

## Updating
If you used git clone you can update the local images on the fly with `git pull`.
RDM will respect the new UIcons index.json file.
Newly added images are loaded immediately, there is no need to restart RDM.
