## Requirements

RealDeviceMap can run anywhere and doesn’t need to be run on MacOS. It doesn’t even need to run in the same network, so you can run RDM on a VPN or similar.

- Docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- docker-compose if not included already) https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-desktop/
- At least one MITM Device-Controller (GC, GDS, Atlas, RDM-UI)
- Existing MySQL Database and user(s), (MySQL 8 or MariaDB 10.5+), or you can use the included database included in the docker.

# Installation

This guide assumes you have the requirements installed.

### RDM Setup Process using Docker

Proceed to setup

- Create a new folder for your compose file for RealDeviceMap:
  - `mkdir rdm`
- Navigate into your new folder:
  - `cd rdm`
- Download the .yml file.
  - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealDeviceMap/RealDeviceMap/master/docker-compose.yml`9

Edit the .yml file with your information:

## Docker DB Version
If you are using the RDM included docker database

Edit the values for 
- `DB_DATABASE` - your database name
- `DB_USERNAME` - db username
- `DB_PASSWORD` - db user password
- `DB_ROOT_USERNAME` - root user
- `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` - root user password

Recommend using rdmuser as the username and a secure password. The username and password should match in both sections.
Edit the value for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` to a secure password for the root user.
Everything else can stay at default

If you run a database on port 3306 already (and not using it for this project):
edit 3306:3306 to 3307:3306 for example. The db will then be accessible on the host (localhost) at port 3307

Start the docker Database Server:
`docker-compose up -d db`

## External DB Version
If you are using an existing database that is external to docker

Edit the values for 
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_DATABASE` 
- `DB_USERNAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD` 
to match your existing database configuration.

Remove or comment out the following lines/sections below (these are for a docker DB) in the docker-compose.yml:
```
depends_on:
- db

...

#  db:
#    image: mysql
#    command: --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
#    container_name: realdevicemap-db
#    restart: unless-stopped
#    environment:
#      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: YourStrongRootPassw0rd!
#      MYSQL_DATABASE: rdmdb
#      MYSQL_USER: rdmuser
#      MYSQL_PASSWORD: YourStrongPassw0rd!
#    ports:
#      - 3306:3306
#    volumes:
#      - data:/var/lib/mysql
#         - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
```

# Start the RealDeviceMap Server 
Don’t add `-d` the first time so we can get the token:

`docker-compose up rdm`

Visit http://localhost:9000/ (or whatever the server ip/hostname to your server is) and create an admin account with the access-token you see in the output of that command in terminal.
The map will start at 0,0 (blue ocean)
Click `Dashboard -> Settings` and edit the start location
RDM is now running on your system
(you can now press `Ctrl-C` to stop in attached mode and start it again with:
`docker-compose up -d rdm`

# Database Event Scheduler
- keep your tables which are growing with history clean (e.g. pokemon, incident, ...)
- use e.g. MySQL Event Scheduler - don't forget to enable it in mysql config `event_scheduler = on`
- example queries are provided in [Scripts](https://github.com/RealDeviceMap/RealDeviceMap/tree/master/Scripts) folder, adapt them for your usage, check the query carefully before executing.
