## Database Event Scheduler
- keep your tables which are growing with history clean (e.g. pokemon, incident, ...)
- use e.g. MySQL Event Scheduler - don't forget to enable it in mysql config `event_scheduler = on`
- example queries are provided in [Scripts](https://github.com/RealDeviceMap/RealDeviceMap/tree/master/Scripts) folder, adapt them for your usage, check the query carefully before executing.
