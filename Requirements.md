Requirements for RealDeviceMap
- **[[Docker|https://www.docker.com/get-started]]** (and [[docker-compose|https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose]] if not included already)
- At least one [[RDM-API-Device-Controller]]

Note: 
RealDeviceMap can run everywhere and doesn't need to run on Mac. It doesn't even need to run in the same network. So you can run RDM on a VPN or similar.
