Requirements for RealDeviceMap
- **[[Docker|https://www.docker.com/get-started]]** (and [[docker-compose|https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose]] if not included already)
- At least one **RealDeviceMap-API device controller** (follow RDM Installation first) <br>
   Currently available RDM-API device controller: 
  -  [[RealDeviceMap-UIControl|https://github.com/123FLO321/RealDeviceMap-UIControl]]<br>
      requires a Jailbroken iOS Device with Poke++ and MacOS (or VM) with Xcode

Note: 
RealDeviceMap can run everywhere and doesn't need to run on Mac. It doesn't even need to run in the same network. So you can run RDM on a VPN or similar.
