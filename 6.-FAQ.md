### Why is my bootstrapping not finishing?
Are you using MariaDB? There exists a [newly introduced "bug"](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27937) in MariaDB. Queries with more than 1000 values in a prepared statement will always return a empty result. In the provided link you will find a workaround. Set that config to 10000, that's the maximum used of RDM.

### PvP settings
RDM calculates the PvP values for little, great and ultra leagues. You can use different [ranking types](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking) as default. Choose the ranking type you or your users prefer. e.g. Ohbem is using competition, but stadiumgaming is using ordinal. Explanation:
* dense (1223 ranking)
* competition (1224 ranking)
* ordinal (1234 ranking)

RDM defaults to dense ranking, so set your environment variable `PVP_DEFAULT_RANK` as you wish.  
RDM filters PvP calculation from every pokemon which does not reach the minimum CP as hundo. You can modifiy the minimum CP in your environment variables. This config was introduced to get rid of annoying rank 1 wurmple.
