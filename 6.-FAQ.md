### Why is my bootstrapping not finishing?
Are you using MariaDB? There exists a [newly introduced "bug"](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27937) in MariaDB. Queries with more than 1000 values in a prepared statement will always return a empty result. In the provided link you will find a workaround. Set that config to 10000, that's the maximum used of RDM.
