# Users

All registered users will be displayed on this page. You can assign a permission group to each user.

# Groups

These are permission groups. You can assign permissions arbitrarily to any group. Admin has all access and it is required to use the RDM API.

# Discord Rules

# Utilities

Here are some useful tools to manage RDM.

* Clear All Quests: this will clear all quest from the database, including quests that are not part of any instances.
* Clear In-Memory Cache: clear memory that is stored in cache (pokemon, pokestop, gym, spawnpoint, weather, incident). Instead loading information from database all the time cache is used. If you modify database entries manually the cache will overwrite the entry again.
* Truncate Pokemon Table: to clear the Pokemon table, because even when spawns have expired, the pokemon are still stored in the database. Recommended before any database migration which is affecting pokemon table.
* Convert Pokestops to Gyms: when certain Pokestops have convert to Gyms in the game, this will copy relevant information from pokestop to gym (e.g. name, photo, ...).
* Delete Stale Pokestops: the number of Pokestops that have not been seen in 24h will be displayed and you can delete these Pokestops from the database.
